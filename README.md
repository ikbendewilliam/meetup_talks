# Meetup talks

These are some of the presentations for the talks I've given at meetups.

## Code generation

Letâ€™s talk about code generation. I will explain how it works, what different ways there are to generate code and show some examples. We will start with very basic generating with simple file manipulation and work our way up to using build_runner and finish with generating a navigator with a simple annotation on you screen widgets.

## build_runner (Lightning talk)

A short talk about tips for build_runner and how to speed up your builds.
